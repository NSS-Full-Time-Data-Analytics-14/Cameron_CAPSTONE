### Motivation

Simply put tornadoes are a natural phenomenon. Thanks to the combination of cold air from North and warm air from the South and the land of the Unite States is so flat, they are almost soly found in the United States that are both a fascinating and terrifying. This project just gives me an excuse to learn more about them and read into their behaviors


•	What are the most common times of year for tornadoes in TN? 
•	How large are they in comparison to each other and do larger ones on average cause more property damage?
•	What years had the most tornadoes?
•	Which years had the most property damage, and do those 2 questions correlate?
•	Which years had the deadliest tornadoes regardless of EF rating?
•	What years had the most powerful?
•	Based on the data has the number increased since the start, or has the opposite happened?
•	What is the average size of each tornado category?


### Data
To answer the aformentioned questions, I gathered data from the Tennessean, National Weather Servcie, and the National Ocenanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). All data has been converted to the currently used Ehanced fujita scale for the sake of uniformality and to refelct modern building standards
